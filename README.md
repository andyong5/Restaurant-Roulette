# RestaurantTournament
I created a Restaurant Tournament app that uses yelp API to narrow down where to go eat with friends. This game starts with a list of 16 restaurants and each round has two restaurants and each player will pick one. After each round, whichever restaurant had the most votes moves onto the next round.
